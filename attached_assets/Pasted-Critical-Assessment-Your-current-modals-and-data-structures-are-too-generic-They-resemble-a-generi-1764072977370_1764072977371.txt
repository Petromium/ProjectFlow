Critical Assessment
Your current modals and data structures are too generic. They resemble a generic project management tool rather than an EPC-specialized PMIS. EPC projects have unique requirements that your current implementation doesn't address.

1. UI/UX Enhancements for EPC Project Managers
What's Missing from Your Dashboard
Your dashboard shows basic metrics (Total Tasks, Completion Rate, Budget Used, Open Risks). That's PM 101. EPC project managers need:

Current	EPC Industry Standard
Completion Rate %	S-Curve with Planned vs Actual vs Earned
Budget Used %	Cost Performance Index (CPI) and Schedule Performance Index (SPI)
Open Risks	Risk Exposure Value (P×I×Cost Impact)
Task list	Phase Gates with approval status
Specific Recommendations:

S-Curve Chart - The #1 visual in EPC. Shows planned progress, actual progress, and earned value over time. Without this, your tool will be rejected by any serious EPC contractor.

SPI/CPI Gauges - Traffic light indicators:

Green: > 0.95
Yellow: 0.85-0.95
Red: < 0.85
Discipline Progress Breakdown - EPC projects track by discipline (Civil, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Piping, Instrumentation). Your current WBS doesn't expose this.

Engineering Hours Curve - Manhours planned vs actual by discipline, critical for EPC cost control.

Procurement Status Widget - Material on order, in transit, at site, installed percentages.

2. New EPC-Specific Features & Tools
Must-Have Features You're Missing:
Feature	Why It's Critical
Transmittal Register	Every document sent/received in EPC has a transmittal number. This is legally required.
Drawing Register	Track revision history, approval status (IFA, IFC, As-Built), discipline, area codes
Vendor Document Register	Track vendor submittals, data sheets, review status
Material Takeoff (MTO) Register	Bill of Materials with quantities, units, and bulk material tracking
RFI (Request for Information) Log	Track questions to client/consultant with response deadlines
Punch List / Snag List	Construction completion checklists by system/area
Commissioning Checklists	System-by-system turnover (mechanical completion, pre-commissioning, commissioning)
LOFC/LOTI Tracking	List of Fabrication Contracts / List of Technical Interfaces
Weight Control	For structural/offshore EPC - track estimated vs actual weights
Progress Measurement System	Rule-based weighting (e.g., 10% design, 20% material, 70% install)
Engineering-Specific Tools:
Interface Register - Track interfaces between disciplines, between contractors, between project phases
Technical Query (TQ) Log - Similar to RFI but for technical clarifications
Deviation/NCR Register - Non-Conformance Reports for quality issues
MOC (Management of Change) - Formal change control beyond your current change requests
Procurement-Specific Tools:
Bid Tabulation - Compare vendor quotes
PO/Subcontract Register - Track purchase orders with milestones and payment terms
Expediting Log - Track material delivery dates and delays
Inspection Release Notes - Track factory inspections
Construction-Specific Tools:
Daily Progress Report - Manpower, equipment, weather, activities completed
HSE Incident Log - Safety metrics (TRIR, LTIR, near misses)
Quality Inspection Records - Hold points, witness points, inspections
3. Modal Enhancement Recommendations
Task Modal - Current Problems:
Your current task modal has: Name, Description, Status, Priority, Dates, Budget, Effort

EPC tasks need:

REQUIRED ADDITIONS:
├── Discipline (Civil, Mech, Elec, Piping, Instrument, Structural)
├── Area/Zone Code (common in plant construction)
├── Weight Factor (% contribution to overall progress)
├── Physical Quantity (e.g., 500 meters of cable, 200 m³ concrete)
├── Unit of Measure
├── Planned Quantity This Period
├── Actual Quantity This Period
├── Cumulative % Complete (quantity-based, not opinion-based)
├── Constraint Type (As Soon As Possible, Start No Earlier Than, etc.)
├── Float (calculated from dependencies)
├── Baseline Start/Finish (for variance tracking)
└── Responsible Contractor/Subcontractor

Risk Modal - Current Problems:
You have: Title, Description, Probability, Impact, Status, Mitigation, Owner

EPC risks need:

REQUIRED ADDITIONS:
├── Risk Category (use AACE categories: Technical, External, Organizational, PM)
├── Response Strategy (Avoid, Transfer, Mitigate, Accept) - NOT just mitigation
├── Cost Impact ($ estimate if risk occurs)
├── Schedule Impact (days delay if risk occurs)
├── Risk Exposure Value (P × I × Impact - auto-calculated)
├── Trigger Events (what conditions activate this risk)
├── Contingency Reserve Allocated
├── Secondary Risks (risks created by mitigation actions)
├── Residual Risk Score (after mitigation)
└── Risk Review Date (scheduled reassessment)

Issue Modal - Current Problems:
Too simple. EPC issues need:

REQUIRED ADDITIONS:
├── Issue Type (Design, Procurement, Construction, Commissioning, HSE, Quality)
├── Impact Assessment (Cost, Schedule, Quality, Safety)
├── Root Cause Category (5 Whys result)
├── Lessons Learned Reference
├── Related Change Request (link to CR if scope change)
├── Escalation Level (Project, Program, Executive)
├── Target Resolution Date (not just reported/resolved)
└── Verification Required (does fix need verification?)

Stakeholder Modal - Current Problems:
Your roles (Sponsor, Client, Contractor, etc.) are too simple.

EPC stakeholder roles should include:

├── Client/Owner Representative
├── PMC (Project Management Consultant)
├── FEED Contractor
├── EPC Contractor (EPCC/EPCM variants)
├── Subcontractor by type (Civil, Mech, E&I, etc.)
├── Equipment Vendor
├── Bulk Material Supplier
├── Third Party Inspector (TPI)
├── Certification Body (ABS, DNV, etc.)
├── Regulatory Authority
├── Lender's Engineer
└── Insurance Surveyor

Add: Communication Preference, Authority Level, Contract Reference

New Modal You Need: Document Modal
EPC is document-heavy. You need a dedicated document tracking system:

Document Modal:
├── Document Number (formatted: PRJ-DIS-AREA-TYPE-SEQ-REV)
├── Title
├── Discipline
├── Document Type (Drawing, Spec, Datasheet, Report, Procedure)
├── Revision (A, B, 0, 1, 2...)
├── Status (Draft, IFA, IFC, As-Built)
├── Originator
├── Checker
├── Approver
├── Transmittal Reference
├── Supersedes Document
├── Related Equipment Tag
├── Required Date
├── Forecast Date
├── Actual Date
└── Review Comments Status (Open, Closed)

My Recommendation Priority
If I were building this for a real EPC contractor, I would implement in this order:

S-Curve + EVA Dashboard - Non-negotiable for any serious EPC tool
Discipline-based Progress Tracking - Add discipline field to tasks
Document Register - EPC runs on documents
Enhanced Risk Modal - Add cost/schedule impact and exposure calculation
RFI/TQ Log - Critical communication tracking
Punch List System - For construction completion
Daily Progress Reporting - Manpower and equipment tracking
Would you like me to create a detailed implementation plan for any of these enhancements? I can break down the schema changes, API endpoints, and UI components needed for each feature.


Thank you! This is a significant undertaking - we're essentially transforming a generic PM tool into a proper EPC PMIS. Let me structure this into phases to ensure we build it right.

Implementation Approach
I'll build this in 5 phases, prioritized by EPC industry importance:

Phase 1: Schema & Data Model Enhancements

Add discipline, area codes, weight factors to tasks
Enhance risk schema with cost/schedule impact, exposure calculation
Enhance issue schema with root cause, escalation levels
Create new tables: documents, transmittals, RFIs, punch_items
Phase 2: Dashboard - S-Curve & EVA

Build S-Curve visualization (Planned vs Actual vs Earned)
Add SPI/CPI gauges with traffic light indicators
Add discipline-based progress breakdown
Add risk exposure summary widget
Phase 3: Enhanced Modals

Enhance Task Modal with discipline, area, quantities, baseline tracking
Enhance Risk Modal with response strategy, cost/schedule impact, triggers
Enhance Issue Modal with impact assessment, root cause, escalation
Enhance Stakeholder Modal with EPC-specific roles
Phase 4: New EPC Registers

Document Register with revision tracking and approval workflow
Transmittal Register for formal document exchange
RFI/TQ Log for information requests
Punch List system for construction completion
Phase 5: Construction & Progress Tools

Daily Progress Report (manpower, equipment, weather)
Progress measurement with rule-based weighting
HSE incident tracking basics
